<br/>
My name is Kimverly or Kim for short. I was born in the Philippines and arrived in Australia back in 2010. At home I can speak both Tagalog and Visaya; Philippines' national languages. I graduated from RMIT back in 2018 and got my Bachelors of Nursing. I’m a big fan of anime and games; my hobbies include playing mmorpg games and reading/watching anime. I also enjoy music and arts and will play the uke and guitar in my spare times. My interest in IT originated with my love for anime and games. This is highly influenced from an anime called "Sword Art Online" where people from around the world can play real-life online games using a high tech version of the VR device. I don't have much IT skills other than trying to fix my laptop when it lags during a game; just basic knowledge to get me through daily work.

<br/>


My name is James or J for short. I was born in Seoul, South Korea and arrived in Australia back in 2006. At home, I can speak Korean. I have extensive career experience in banking, and as a consultant. I’m a big fan of soccer and outdoor activities. My hobbies tend to include going to the gym and lifting weights, playing soccer in a team and at times reading in my spare time to pass time. I also enjoy playing the piano, where I have started since I was 7 years old. My interest in IT originated from seeing big tech heroes like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. Seeing them take a step each day to make our lives better for our future is truly inspirational and I too, would like to be part of similar industries. I have very little experience when it comes to IT skills, however, I have used a few softwares like Salesforce and Acuity Scheduling, Monday.com and few other CRM softwares.

<br/>

>The result of this test means that I tend to see life as a big, complex puzzle where everything is interconnected. I work really well in a team as I am easily agreeable and like to keep the environment in a peaceful and civil manner. I'm also not afraid to stick up for what is right and will always or most likely get along with everyone in the team. My open-mindedness helps with decision-making while my extrovert personally can help reach out to others who are afraid to have a say during group discussions.
There are a few personality types I won't be able to agree with but I can work well in any team that are able to come to a conclusion regarding what they want the end goal of the team project to be. I am kind to a fault and will always play the role of the "peace keeper" which will prove beneficial during group project designations.

<br/>


>The test results indicated that I approach life as a creative playground where I can explore different opportunities in a very imaginative, open-minded and curious manner. Working in a team environment is something that I can thrive in as I am very observative and analytical, as well as always looking for a better solution for the team. I believe social harmony and cooperation is one of the key important factors when working in a group. Being able to approach tasks with a decisive, thorough and highly organized manner, I can help our team to finish set tasks in a structured timeline so we can all achieve a great end result. 

<br/>

## Teamwork Style
>Both our test results shows how we both thrive in a team environment by utilising our opend-mindedness and positive attitude towards creating peace and harmony in our group. This will allow better structured group designations to complete our tasks in a timely manner to achieve better outcomes in our group assignments.

https://appreal-vr.com/blog/virtual-reality-and-artificial-intelligence/

<br/>

>Our ideal jobs both consist of helping create technological advancement in the future. I would like to manufacture VRs similar to “Black Mirrors” earbud sized headsets which would enable players’ mind and body to be fully immersed in a VR world. This is a massive project as it resolves the understanding of the human mind and how technology can be incorporated to enable partial/full control of the brain. The same as James’ ideal job of developing AI’s to help assist with daily needs such as voice assist and being able to use AI technology in the healthcare industry to assist with surgeries as well as detect possible cancer cells to stop and prevent the spread of the disease before it is too late. The impact this technology will bring to our society is not only to save time but lives as well. 
 It will serve to act as the foundation upon which the virtual environment will exist.

<br/>
 
 ### Thoughts on IT
 <br/>
 
>With both the complex systems together combined, the VR and AI will essentially change our perspectives towards opening up channels for healthcare, education, business, and entertainment.The advancement of technology is making a massive shift in how it impacts the way we live, work, and entertain ourselves. Big business game plays are coming and at the heart of it will be virtual reality and artificial intelligence. But as our technology advances, is our generation becoming lazier from the alteration of making anything and everything easier in our daily lives with the help of technology?

## Interview Questions with IT Professional who's working in Cybersecurity industry as a penetration tester

<br/>

![cyber security](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62003066/79632823-116a7d80-81a5-11ea-835c-26d1207f8104.jpg)
<br/>
https://www.csoonline.com/article/3257672/us-cybersecurity-threat-risk-remains-high-no-signs-of-lessening.html

<br/>

Penetration Tester: Praveen. K
<br/>

**Why did you choose Cyber Security?
<br/>

>"I was greatly influenced by “The Matrix” and “Ghost in the shell”. Since I was 7, technology has been a great part of me. I’m also a gamer and I get very frustrated when hackers make themselves invulnerable by downloading illegal systems to the game. This made me research about hacking and I came across cyber security."
<br/>

**How long have you been in Cyber Security for?
<br/>

>"I've been in Cybersecurity since 2010. I started from back home in Deli, India and soon found myself in love with pen-testing or penetration testing. I moved to Australia as I got a job opportunity with IBM and a contractor working for big Airlines such as Qantas and Jetstar. My latest work was testing the Qantas database and running multiple penetration testing to check the security level of the Airline."
<br/>

**Where do you spend most of your time working as a pen-tester?
<br/>

>"Usually in the IBM office, where we work in small group of 4 people per team on a given day. Occationally, travelling to other locations to run tests. However, nowadays we are all working from home because of Coronavirus and we're making slow changes so some of us can work from home in the future as well, and not necessarily having to come into the office. I think that's the beauty of working in most of the IT industry. Most of the work can be done remotely and it is a future proof, crisis proof industry."
<br/>

**What aspect of your position is most challenging?
<br/>

>"There's no particular instructions or guidelines when it comes to penetration testing. You have to be creative in many ways and think like a hacker would think. Being able to come up with different tactics to break the system, being able to put myself into the hacker's shoes and actually wanting to illegally gain sensitive company data, or even being able to try the same thing with a little variations over and over again so we make sure there is no issues. That would be the most challenging part of my role, but that said, it is the most fun and rewarding part of the job as well. If you're the type of person who is persistent and can let your imagination help with the work, you'll enjoy your role in Cybersecurity or as a pen-tester."
<br/>

**What can one do if they want to get into a Cybersecurity career?
<br/>

>"Well, this can be answered in a very simple way or elaborated way.
The short and simple answer is, know how to hack, apply for entry level positions and work your way up.
The long, elaborated answer would be, you not only need to know how to hack but also how to think like a hacker. Being able to put yourself into hacker's shoes and being able to emulate their intentions is a key skill to have. The person should have a strong ethics but also understanding what is right and wrong. Knowing the right skillsets will definitely help. But, what will help you in the long run is having grit, being able to be persistent. Being able to find creative ways to come up with different, various solutions is what will differentiate you from a good pen-tester to an exceptional pen-tester."

>Cyber Security is the state or process of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It is comprised of an evolving set of tools, risk management approaches, technologies and training that applies to a variety of contexts from business to computing. It is designed to protect networks, devices, and programs from unauthorized access and can be divided into categories.
<br/>

•	Network Security: Securing computer network from intruders
<br/>
•	Application Security: Keeping software and devices free of threats
<br/>
•	Information Security: Protection of privacy of data in storage and transit
<br/>
•	Operational Security: Processes and decision handling for permission users to determine how and where to store and share data.
<br/>
•	Disaster recovery and business continuity: Defines how an organisation will respond to cyber-security incident or other events that leads to operation or data loss.
<br/>
•	End-user education: Teaching users to delete suspicious emails and attachments due to unpredicted cyber-security factor.
<br/>

According to a research by RAND Corporation, the current state-of-the-art cybersecurity is in suffers from the scarcity of reliable, verifiable date due to large scale and longitudinal datasets from across many of the findings. Thus, making it difficult to define and understand the challenge or problem in the field of cybersecurity. Furthermore, there are identified gaps which includes a lack of research into cybersecurity within a worldwide context, ethics and legal concerns and major game changers such as the dark web, artificial intelligence, and quantum-related technologies.
<br/>

The scale of cyber threat is a global phenomenon which continues to evolve at a rapid pace with the rising of IT development. According to RiskBased Security, in 2019 alone, more than 7.9 billion records have been exposed by data breaches which is more than 112% compared to 2018’s figure of records exposure. Cybercriminals target fields such as the medical services, retailers and the public due to the collection of financial and medical data they hold. A data by International Data Corporation predicts $133.7 billion will be spent on cybersecurity by 2022. Cybercriminals use cyber threats such as:
<br/>

•	Cybercrime: Targeting of systems in a single or group factor to gain financially or disrupt activities.
<br/>
•	Cyber-attack: Politically motivated information gathering
<br/>
•	Cyberterrorism: Uses electronic systems to cause panic or fear. 
<br/>
•	Malware: Is a malicious software used for cyber threatening by disrupting or destroying software’s by using viruses, trojans, spyware, ransomware, adware, and botnets.
<br/>

Cybersecurity is constantly evolving and in 3 years’ time billions more will be spent due to the rise of high demands for this field. As technology rapidly evolves, criminal doings will too for the opportunity of financial gain and causing harm to targeted users. It is estimated that, on average, a data breach costs an affected organization $3.6 million. With high-profile data breaches making media headlines, it is essential that organizations adopt and implement a strong cybersecurity approach.
Developing better security in technology is paramount as ways to hack and disrupt software’s are readily available in the internet. Today’s cyber security teams should be able to handle and come up with new tactics to fend off highly advanced threats against the increasingly interconnected enterprise networks. The potential impact of technology rising means more job opportunities for the security team. According to Burning Glass, IT skills are in high demand and with the COVID-19 occurring right now, it will continue to rise as everyone is staying and working from home and what do they use, technology of course. This will create more job opportunities for more people as IT course are mainly done online such as the course I am taking. With a laptop or computer handy and an adequate internet connection, people who lost their job because of the pandemic can easily access information regarding IT as so much information are given away for free on the internet. The government are also helping by creating job opportunities for the affected plus free courses are readily made available by the government for those who cannot afford to study. Cyber security will be one of the highest in-demand jobs in the future due to the rise of technology as the more people create the more other people will destroy.
<br/>

Social media such as Facebook, Instagram and twitter are famous for becoming hacked which can breach user’s privacy exposing cybercriminals to information which can be used for harassment or financial gain. More and more people are getting baited using cybercriminals malwares that comes up on most free websites. As technology advances, parents are more likely to give their kids gadgets at a younger age which compromises their identity when certain apps and websites are visited with their name, age and email address being requested before sites and apps can be used. Cybercriminals discriminates on the younger and older generation with little or no knowledge to technology. Just by providing your name and date of birth, hackers can find out more information by using social media to track down your Facebook If not set on private which they can then be used to harass the user. Criminal activities like these are often due to the rapid increase of the social media empire. I have been a victim of malwares myself as I usually ignore warning and open sites without thinking. Recently a friend of mines identity has been stolen and her Facebook has been reported for being the fake one. Instances like this occur daily where people will message you links due to their account being hack by criminals and very often their friends. Other methods hackers will gain your information is through online shopping; my mum and friends credit card details has been hacked and used overseas by using eBay and Amazon. As stated before, billions of data are being breached by the second due to improper use of technology and software, and cybersecurity must evolve and expand their horizon with the upcoming rise of technology.

### Autonomous vehicles
<br/>

![batman](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62003066/79678438-f5b3b580-823e-11ea-87a1-8e041d2c3f94.jpg)
<br/>
https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/13/9132485/batman-arkham-knight-batmobile
<br/>

>What is an autonomous vehicle and why are they revolutionizing vehicles in today’s generation? An autonomous vehicle is basically anything that can transport without any human conduction; for simplicity, an example would be a car that can drive itself. Machines have come so far regarding further modifications of their functions and the ability to go almost anywhere whether that will be deep in the trenches of the sea using echolocations in the submarine or space and land on the moon. For now, we will be focusing on the famous automatic, self-driving cars that caused a major hype and shock in the industry.

How exactly do self-driving car works? Engineers have been attempting to create fully auto-piloted cars for decades and the idea behind it is very simple; gear up a car with tons of cameras that can sense and track objects around it to have to ability to react to any dangers while also having the technology to navigate itself. Of course, as dictated from countless speeding and rule breaking tickets from highway officers, autonomous cars should also have the ability to abide traffic rules and regulations. Aren’t humans already struggling to do that from the start and now were teaching cars to follow those rules?
<br/>

Take for example googles self-driving car, Waymo. The project started back in 2009 with the vision of making it easy and safe for everyone to get to their destination while lowering the chances of car accidents. According to the World Health Organisation, millions of people die each year from road related accidents (https://extranet.who.int/roadsafety/death-on-the-roads/) with 1 death around the world for every 23 seconds. Factors such as disabilities and age are also responsible for these deaths and accidents. Waymo is the leading industry for self-driving cars along with Elon Musk’s vision of creating Tesla cars fully autonomous. It is high-resolution cameras and light detection and ranging allowing it to estimate distances to objects by bouncing light and sound off things. The car contains computer systems that can build a picture of where other cars, cyclist, obstacles, and pedestrians are and where they are moving to avoid accidents. To establish accurate data collection, cars must draw on millions of miles of driving data to form expectations about how other objects might move.
<br/>

Self-driving cars are making a revolutionary change in the industry. In the next 3 years, we will be seeing big players like google and tesla create fully auto-piloted cars with the help of technology such as the AI’s and VR’s. Why is it taking longer than expected to get self-driving cars on the road? For autonomous vehicles to be successful, they have to highly rely on AI’s and their ability to think for humans. There are limitations on how much AI’s can do and with this comes the navigation of our roads with high degree of reliability regarding the ability of solving real-world problems. To solve this, cars will need millions of car data from any incident that can be encountered; car engineers even created and trained car in simulations to create situations where obstacles are pre-deployed to obtain data on how the car and its computer system would react.
<br/>

Fair enough, were humans and we make mistakes and if we create AI’s with billions of data and information, they are less likely to or will not make mistakes at all. But what will happen to those whose job is to get us safely to our destinations? The taxi drivers and uber drivers’ jobs will be made redundant. Or for truck drivers and other vehicle drivers that makes their living by transporting goods? Some might argue that as humans we have temptations such as alcohol and drug consumptions and of course we also need our sleep. Countless of incidents have occurred due to vehicle drivers falling asleep in the road and waking up to having killed an innocent driver. Malicious intents also occur daily around the world with taxi and uber drivers threatening to kidnap and rape those whose only intent is to get home safely. Of course, we are in the backseat of a stranger’s car and were relying on them to be heavenly sent who will do the right thing all the time. With AI’s, there will not be instances where that will or can occur. Technology is so advanced that we can do real-time changes if needed be on software’s that will disable or fix any errors. And if it is an attack from cybercriminals such as hackers, we have the cyber security team for that. We are constantly trying to make daily living easier for humans by humans by creating and experimenting with no place for mistakes. In saying that, in March 18, 2018, for the first time ever, a woman was killed by a self-driving car who was riding her bicycle across the street. With this information, autonomous vehicles have a long way to go as AI’s cannot fully function like the human brain quite just yet. 
<br/>

In my opinion, I will not be able to be inside a self-driving car as being on the road scares myself in the first place. I do not want to have the guilt and burden on having my car kill someone due to a malfunction that could have been avoided if I was driving myself. Car accidents occur either from dumb and stupid drivers who should not be in the road in the first place and unexpected events. It is called unexpected in the first place and if humans cannot react to it to avoid it, how can AI’s do the same? I guess if they have better high-quality motion cameras and echolocations that can only be found on submarines and spaceships, we might have a chance with creating this revolutionary machine.
<br/>

### Machine Learning
<br/>

![walle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62003066/79677349-b338ab80-8233-11ea-9120-9205a4ce66cb.jpg)
<br/>
https://blogs.ubc.ca/angryvietnamese/2016/02/17/revisiting-wall-e/
<br/>

>Let’s talk about Machine learning. I’m sure you’ve heard of this terminology thrown around before, especially if you’re a big technology fan or a sci-fi movie fan like myself. Machine learning refers to an application or a system of Artificial Intelligence. It gives the computer system to learn by absorbing information, and essentially build up from an experience without having a programmer explicitly program the system. Simply said, it’s a branch of artificial intelligence. The system can learn autonomously from given data by identifying its objects and patterns observed and make an informed final decision with zero to minimal human interventions.
<br/>

When it comes to machine learning you might be wondering, what can it be done right now, as of this exact moment? Well, simply said, a lot of things. But it doesn’t mean that we’re near perfect. There are a lot of aspects and areas still to be explored and delved into in more depth until we master the state of this art. We have Virtual Personal Assistants such as – Siri, Amazon Alexa, Bixby and Google – which we have all heard of. There are also traffic predictions when we’re using Google GPS where it predicts traffic, video surveillance using facial recognition, product recommendations and even, autocorrect on our phones and word documents. Pretty cool right?
<br/>

It’s actually quite impressive to know that we’re not far off from the utopian future we’ve only dreamed of, something that was only from a movie, where all these different kind of Machine Learning technologies are already being implemented in a very convenient and seamless way within our daily lives. But there’s more. More ways machine learning can thrive into far more different fields and industries, especially in the upcoming years. Unfortunately, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence being used in the medical industry or healthcare industry is too soon to say as the Harvard research suggests. So, what will thrive within the next three years? What will thrive the most is Virtual Voice Assistant. For example, Google is currently in the works of expanding their “Google assistant’s ability to understand personal references.” Such as, if a user says, “Hey Google, what’s the weather like at Mum’s house,” Google will be able to determine that “Mum’s house” refers to the home of the user’s mother, look up her address and provide a weather forecast for her city. It will be implemented in such a way that will add an additional touch of convenience as our daily devices like mobile phone can better understand us.
<br/>

So, what technological aspect or development areas make machine learning possible? Machine learning analyses data given and it automates an analytical model building or structure. Being able to recognize and identify patterns and train over and over again improves the ability of an A.I. The development areas that makes machine learning possible are the ability to adequately define our problem, objective and desired outputs, able to gather data, and implementing learning process. 
<br/>

Machine learning, artificial intelligence is considered to be one of the biggest innovations since the microchip. It is a concept from movies and science fiction novels brought to reality. The impact machine learning can bring to our humanity varies, and the majority of the impacts are the positives. Making us live happier, healthier and more productive lifestyles. Let’s name a few examples. Self-driving cars and automated transportation. Despite following the road rules, we are human being after all, we all can make mistakes and sometimes, just sometimes, those mistakes can be critical and bring misfortune to ourselves but to our friends and families as well. Automated vehicles offer greater road safety. Automation can help reduce the number of crashes or accidents that happen quite regularly. It’ll also be a great convenience for people with disabilities, who are incapable of self-sufficiency. It can help them live the life they want. Another greater impact it can bring to all of us is increase our productivity levels. In a fully automated vehicle, all occupants could safely pursue their daily tasks such as checking their emails and texts, reading, being on a phone call or even meditate or have that piece of mind when commuting to work. Things that will be likely to change are the job opportunities available. People that will be affected the most are transport drivers, train operators, uber drivers, essentially who works as a vehicle operator. The way for them to make money will be gone and they’ll be forced out of jobs and find another way to create cashflow. Replacing manual work with automated systems, it is inevitable that it will make a lot of people in these industries redundant.  
<br/>

How will this change affect me? It will have a very positive impact on my daily lives and my schedule. I am pro-technology and cannot wait for these changes to come into place permanently. It will not only increase my productivity levels but it will free up time in my day. That will be the major difference for me. How it would affect my family members or friends is also very similar. Even my grandparents are quite tech-savvy, as well as my parents. They welcome change and are very open-minded. They are also very fast to adapt and implement new technologies or systems in their daily lives. As working professionals, for myself and for my friends, we will all appreciate the change as it will provide us with more opportunities to allocate extra hours in our days to something else, give us the piece of mind, being able to relax when driving, and much more. If you’re not open to these changes and against it, I would first ask you, why? Wouldn’t you want more time throughout your day? Wouldn’t you want that piece of mind on your commute to work? Wouldn’t you want more convenience?

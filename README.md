<br/>
My name is Kimverly or Kim for short. I was born in the Philippines and arrived in Australia back in 2010. At home I can speak both Tagalog and Visaya; Philippines' national languages. I graduated from RMIT back in 2018 and got my Bachelors of Nursing. I’m a big fan of anime and games; my hobbies include playing mmorpg games and reading/watching anime. I also enjoy music and arts and will play the uke and guitar in my spare times. My interest in IT originated with my love for anime and games. This is highly influenced from an anime called "Sword Art Online" where people from around the world can play real-life online games using a high tech version of the VR device. I don't have much IT skills other than trying to fix my laptop when it lags during a game; just basic knowledge to get me through daily work.

My name is James or J for short. I was born in Seoul, South Korea and arrived in Australia back in 2006. At home, I can speak Korean. I have extensive career experience in banking, and as a consultant. I’m a big fan of soccer and outdoor activities. My hobbies tend to include going to the gym and lifting weights, playing soccer in a team and at times reading in my spare time to pass time. I also enjoy playing the piano, where I have started since I was 7 years old. My interest in IT originated from seeing big tech heroes like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. Seeing them take a step each day to make our lives better for our future is truly inspirational and I too, would like to be part of similar industries. I have very little experience when it comes to IT skills, however, I have used a few softwares like Salesforce and Acuity Scheduling, Monday.com and so on.

>The result of this test means that I tend to see life as a big, complex puzzle where everything is interconnected. I work really well in a team as I am easily agreeable and like to keep the environment in a peaceful and civil manner. I'm also not afraid to stick up for what is right and will always or most likely get along with everyone in the team. My open-mindedness helps with decision-making while my extrovert personally can help reach out to others who are afraid to have a say during group discussions.
There are a few personality types I won't be able to agree with but I can work well in any team that are able to come to a conclusion regarding what they want the end goal of the team project to be. I am kind to a fault and will always play the role of the "peace keeper" which will prove beneficial during group project designations.

>The test results indicated that I approach life as a creative playground where I can explore different opportunities in a very imaginative, open-minded and curious manner. Working in a team environment is something that I can thrive in as I am very observative and analytical, as well as always looking for a better solution for the team. I believe social harmony and cooperation is one of the key important factors when working in a group. Being able to approach tasks with a decisive, thorough and highly organized manner, I can help our team to finish set tasks in a structured timeline so we can all achieve a great end result. 

<br/>

## Teamwork Style
>Both our test results shows how we both thrive in a team environment by utilising our opend-mindedness and positive attitude towards creating peace and harmony in our group. This will allow better structured group designations to complete our tasks in a timely manner to achieve better outcomes in our group assignments.

>Our ideal jobs both consist of helping create technological advancement in the future. I would like to manufacture VRs similar to “Black Mirrors” earbud sized headsets which would enable players’ mind and body to be fully immersed in a VR world. This is a massive project as it resolves the understanding of the human mind and how technology can be incorporated to enable partial/full control of the brain. The same as James’ ideal job of developing AI’s to help assist with daily needs such as voice assist and being able to use AI technology in the healthcare industry to assist with surgeries as well as detect possible cancer cells to stop and prevent the spread of the disease before it is too late. The impact this technology will bring to our society is not only to save time but lives as well. 
 It will serve to act as the foundation upon which the virtual environment will exist.

<br/>

## Thoughts on IT
 
>With both the complex systems together combined, the VR and AI will essentially change our perspectives towards opening up channels for healthcare, education, business, and entertainment.The advancement of technology is making a massive shift in how it impacts the way we live, work, and entertain ourselves. Big business game plays are coming and at the heart of it will be virtual reality and artificial intelligence. But as our technology advances, is our generation becoming lazier from the alteration of making anything and everything easier in our daily lives with the help of technology?
